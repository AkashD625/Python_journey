#sets are the as similer as list , but while printting them back they dont print the same valuse and they are not in order .
# if there are many similer elements in set then they will print it in single time .

s = {5,2,1,4,5,9,4}
print(s)

# to create the empty set
akash = set()
print(type(akash))

# Another method of printing the sets 
for i in s:
      print(s)



# ---------------There are many set methods on internet
